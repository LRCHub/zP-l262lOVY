I'll see you at the movies
I see you with your lipstick on
I'm looking at the cosmos
I'm hoping that we get along
It's time for innovation
It's time for us to make a
change
It's time for a Chinese new year
It's time for me to make a way
And I can't, no I can't wait to
get far from here
No I can't, I can't wait to get
out of here
No I can't, no I can't, no I
can't wait to get out of here
I'll see you at the movies
I see you with your lipstick on
I'm looking at the cosmos
I'm hoping that we get along
It's time for innovation
It's time for us to make a
change
It's time for a Chinese new year
It's time for me to make a way
Sweared a lot and I bared a lot
I was there a lot last year
Wept a lot, oh baby you slept a
lot
I was left a lot last year
Pleased a lot, baby you seized
my heart
And I started to fall last year
