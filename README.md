[00:05.30] I'll see you at the movies
[00:08.45] I'll see you with your lipstick on
[00:11.74] I'm looking out for cosmos
[00:14.85] I'm hoping that we'll get along
[00:18.17] It's time for renovation
[00:21.37] It's time for us to make a change
[00:24.64] It's time for a Chinese new year
[00:27.87] It's time for me to make a way
[00:42.87] 
[00:31.27] Then I can't
[00:34.58] No, I can't wait to
[00:37.43] Get back from here
[00:40.93] No, I can't
[00:43.48] I can't wait to get out of here
[00:47.56] No, I can't
[00:50.42] No, I can't
[00:52.17] No, I can't
[00:53.62] Wait to get out of here
[01:05.12] 
[00:56.36] I'll see you at the movies
[00:59.60] I'll see you with your lipstick on
[01:02.87] I'm looking out for cosmos
[01:06.23] I'm hoping that we'll get along
[01:09.37] It's time for renovation
[01:12.76] It's time for us to make a change
[01:15.81] It's time for a Chinese new year
[01:19.09] It's time for me to make a way
[01:34.09] 
[01:48.63] Sweared a lot
[01:51.42] And I bared a lot
[01:54.67] I was there a lot
[01:57.72] Last year
[02:01.53] Wept a lot
[02:03.84] Oh baby, you slept a lot
[02:07.33] I was left a lot
[02:10.59] Last year
[02:14.29] Pleased a lot
[02:16.79] Baby, you seized my heart
[02:20.26] And I
[02:21.36] Started to fall last year
